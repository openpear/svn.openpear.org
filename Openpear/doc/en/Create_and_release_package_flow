* Create and release package flow

Here is a work flow on the Openpear.
# Create a new package (on openpear.org)
# Check-out it, edit files and commit that (on your local)
# Release setting on the administration page and release it (on openpear.org)

How Openpear works on each work flow?  Openpear works so many jobs automatically.

** Create package

After you create new package, Openpear will:
- Create svn repository (if you do not use external repository).
-- trunk : development code
-- tags : release tags
-- branches : branches directory (

** On commit

- Create changeset permalink
- Timeline update

** Release

Once you release the pacakage, Openpear will:
- Build PEAR pacakage in accordance with your settings,
- Register the package archive to the channel server of Openpear,
- Create svn tag to the repository,
- Timeline update.
